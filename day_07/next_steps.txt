I've created a interpreter of instruction that works for a circuit that is in the correct order
However, compared to example output, the user output is not ordered by dependency, so we need to sort it before using our program
To do so we'll create a dependency map that has instruction pointing to what it needs,
some instruction need nothing using this we'll give an index to each operation depending on how far in the tree they are.
